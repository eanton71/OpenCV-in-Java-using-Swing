# Work in Progress
# OpenCV in Java using Swing
eclipse: 
Kepler Release 2 for rcp/rap developer.
Install swing designer from the kepler repo.

Opencv:
version 2.4.11 for windows.
add opencv to eclipse by following http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/java_eclipse/java_eclipse.html .

What it does:
1. Open camera using opencv and draw the contents in an awt canvas. 
2. It doesnt do any image processing yet.

TODO:
Add imageprocessing. 
Canny isnt really working, just a placeholder for now.
